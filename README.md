# pcb_hotplate
A hotplate for soldering SMD to your pcb's
Most commercial hotplates are ethier too small, too expensive or dont support reflow profiles. My hotplate aims to help with those problems by having a heating area of 400mm by 100mm, and a reflow profile system which comes with tempreture tracking and adaptavily changing the tempreture based on that to match the heating profile. The entire system can be built for under 
$150

I made this project to learn more about how exactly does generating heat work and to better understand the work that goes into SMD soldering. I made this mainly because another project of mine requires SMD soldering so I thought it would be better to make my own hotplate than to just buy one from online.
